- `123456789_doctor_name_report_MM_DD_YYYY.txt`: An individual doctor's weekly billing report. (Needs better description), also possibly better naming conventions for the two 'report' files
- `123456789_member_name_report_MM_DD_YYYY.txt`: An individual member's weekly billing report. (Needs better description)
- `provider_summary_report_MM_DD_YYYY`: IDK (Needs better description)
